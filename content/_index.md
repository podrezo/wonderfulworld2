As a frequenter of the [travel subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/travel), an avid traveller and a history buff, I often saw people's beautiful photos of faraway exotic lands and saved them for viewing later and sharing with friends. "WonderfulWorld" started because I kept saving links to these fantastic photos until the list grew too big and unmanagable. I thought it would be awesome to have a little lightweight website that features the best of these photos as a means of providing travel inspiration for myself and others. This website is the result, I hope you enjoy using it!
