Civita di Bagnoregio is a hilltop village in central Italy. Itâ€™s accessed via a pedestrian bridge from the nearby ticket office in Bagnoregio village. The Porta Santa Maria gateway was built by the Etruscans. Founded in the 7th century, the Romanesque San Donato Church sits in the main square. Nearby is the Geological and Landslides Museum, whose exhibits document projects to shore up the village's eroding hillside.
