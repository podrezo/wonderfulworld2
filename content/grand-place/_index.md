La Grand Place (Grote Markt in Dutch) is the iconic central square in the Belgian capital Brussels. The square is surrounded by the city's Town Hall, nearly forty guildhalls and other beautiful buildings from the 14th to 17th century. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and is widely considered the most beautiful town square in Europe. Every two years in August, an enormous flower carpet is set up in La Grand Place for a few days. A million colorful begonias are set up in geometric patterns covering an area of 1,800 square meters.
