Kawachi Fujien Garden (河内藤園) is a private garden in the wooded hills south of central Kitakyushu, famous for its spectacularly presented, large numbers of wisteria flowers. The garden's most prominent features are two, roughly 100 meter long tunnels made of wisteria trees of differing varieties and colors, and a collection of large wisteria trees that together form an enormous roof of drooping flowers.
