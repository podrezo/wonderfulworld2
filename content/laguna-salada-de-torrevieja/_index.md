Laguna Salada de Torrevieja is a salt lake near Torrevieja, Spain. The lake's blushing pink hue is created by a special algae that grows in highly salty water. The algae reacts with sunlight, thus the lake can often appear different colors depending on the time of day. The water in this lake is saltier than sea water, allowing swimmers to float effortlessly on the surface.
