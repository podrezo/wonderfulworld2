Mount Rigi occupies a prominent place in the history of tourism. It has attracted tourists from around the world for nearly 150 years. Prior to 1871, people ascended Mount Rigi by foot or were carried in sedan chairs. In 1871, when the Rigi Railway from Vitznau started operating, reaching the summit of Mount Rigi became more comfortable and accessible for everyone.
