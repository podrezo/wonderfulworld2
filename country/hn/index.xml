Local legend has it that there is buried treasure on the island. When the original owner was constructing the villas, he discovered a hidden cave on the island. He found many pieces of pre-Colombian pottery, but sadly no treasure. But he started construction on what would soon become a new jewel in the Caribbean.</description></item></channel></rss>
