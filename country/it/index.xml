The five lands comprises five villages: Monterosso al Mare, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore. The coastline, the five villages, and the surrounding hillsides are all part of the Cinque Terre National Park (Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre). Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that overlook the sea. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages. It is best to travel into Cinque Terre towns via train, as they are not entirely accessible by car.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Civita di Bagnoregio</title><link>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/civita-di-bagnoregio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/civita-di-bagnoregio/</guid><description>&lt;p>Civita di Bagnoregio is a hilltop village in central Italy.

The road is remarkably well preserved, its large flat paving stones polished by millennia of use and weathering, and standing as testament to the might of Roman engineering. Today the road is flanked on both sides by verdant fields punctuated with ruins and other vestiges of Roman history, with the occasional herds of grazing sheep adding to the sense of being transported back in time. Easily accessible from Rome, this free tourist attraction literally takes a trip down Rome&amp;rsquo;s memory lane.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
