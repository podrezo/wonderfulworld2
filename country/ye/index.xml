Its red sap was thought to be the dragon&amp;rsquo;s blood of the ancients, sought after as a dye, and today used as paint and varnish. Also important in ancient times were Socotra&amp;rsquo;s various endemic aloes, used medicinally, and for cosmetics. Other endemic plants include the giant succulent tree Dorstenia gigas, the cucumber tree Dendrosicyos socotranus, the rare Socotran pomegranate, Aloe perryi, and Boswellia socotrana.</description></item></channel></rss>
