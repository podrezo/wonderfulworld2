It was established in the late twelfth century by King Jayavarman VII. It covers an area of 9 km², within which are located several monuments from earlier eras as well as those established by Jayavarman and his successors. At the centre of the city is Jayavarman&amp;rsquo;s state temple, the Bayon, with the other major sites clustered around the Victory Square immediately to the north. The site is one of the major tourist attractions of southeast Asia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Angkor Wat</title><link>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/angkor-wat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/angkor-wat/</guid><description>&lt;p>Angkor Wat is a temple complex in Cambodia and the largest religious monument in the world.

These waterfalls are a favourite side trip for tourists in Luang Prabang. The falls begin in shallow pools atop a steep hillside. These lead to the main fall with a 60 metres (200 ft)cascade. The falls are accessed via a trail to a left of the falls. The water collects in numerous turquoise blue pools as it flows downstream. The many cascades that result are typical of travertine waterfalls.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mù Cang Chải</title><link>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/mu-cang-chai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/mu-cang-chai/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mù Cang Chải manages to be one of the most breathtaking spots in Vietnam, with terraced rice fields and mountainous landscapes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nara Deer Park</title><link>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/nara-deer-park/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/nara-deer-park/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nara Park (奈良公園, Nara Kōen) is a large park in central Nara. Established in 1880, it is the location of many of Nara&amp;rsquo;s main attractions including Todaiji, Kasuga Taisha, Kofukuji and the Nara National Museum. The park is home to hundreds of freely roaming deer. Considered in Shinto to be messengers of the gods, Nara&amp;rsquo;s nearly 1200 deer have become a symbol of the city and have even been designated as a natural treasure. Nara&amp;rsquo;s deer are surprisingly tame, although they can be aggressive if they think you will feed them. Deer crackers are for sale around the park, and some deer have learned to bow to visitors to ask to be fed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
