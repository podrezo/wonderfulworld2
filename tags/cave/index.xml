&lt;p>It is 24 m long, 10-12 meters wide, 15 inches tall and 16 m deep. The entrance to the cave is about 1.5 m high and about 2.5 m wide with a long sea corridor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cave has two openings, one smaller, one artificially deepened, through which the boat can pass. The other opening is like a vault and much wider, on the south side of the cave, below the sea level. The underwater canopy through the cave floods the sunlight, which, passing through the water, first disappears, and then falls from the bottom of the cave, filling the entire cave with a silver-blue resin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coober Pedy</title><link>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/coober-pedy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/coober-pedy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Coober Pedy is a town in southern Australia which around 150 million years ago was covered by ocean. When the water receded, the sandy silica minerals from the seabed flowed into the rocky cracks and cavities and solidified over time into the multi-coloured gem-stone, opal. Traditionally it has been a mining town ever since the discovery of opal, but the existing cavernous mines coupled with the intense heat outside made some people take a novel approach to building - going underground.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ellison's Cave</title><link>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/ellisons-cave/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/ellisons-cave/</guid><description>&lt;p>This pit cave is located on the Pigeon Mountain range on the Northwest of Georgia.
