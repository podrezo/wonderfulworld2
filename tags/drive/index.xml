It roughly follows the &amp;ldquo;Old Natchez Trace&amp;rdquo; a historic travel corridor used by American Indians, &amp;ldquo;Kaintucks,&amp;rdquo; European settlers, slave traders, soldiers, and future presidents. Today, people can enjoy not only a scenic drive but also hiking, biking, horseback riding, and camping along the parkway.
The Sunken Trace is one of the most photographed sites along the Parkway.</description></item></channel></rss>
