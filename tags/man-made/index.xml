When the water receded, the sandy silica minerals from the seabed flowed into the rocky cracks and cavities and solidified over time into the multi-coloured gem-stone, opal. Traditionally it has been a mining town ever since the discovery of opal, but the existing cavernous mines coupled with the intense heat outside made some people take a novel approach to building - going underground.</description></item><item><title>Dunbar Rock</title><link>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/dunbar-rock/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wonderfulworld.podrezo.com/dunbar-rock/</guid><description>This beautiful historical landmark was once used as a mooring for the famous pirate Blackbeard.

Today the road is flanked on both sides by verdant fields punctuated with ruins and other vestiges of Roman history, with the occasional herds of grazing sheep adding to the sense of being transported back in time.</description></item></channel></rss>
